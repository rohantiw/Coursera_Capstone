Its diversity is reflected in Toronto\u2019s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal etc. It is one of the most immigrant-friendly cities in North America with more than half of the entire Indian Canadian population residing in Toronto that makes it one of the best places to start an Indian restaurant.\n\nThe purpose of this whole exercise is for submission of final capstone project for **\"IBM Data Science\"** course on coursera as well as to showcase my data science skills in the real world application."
